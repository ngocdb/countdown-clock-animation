# countdown-clock-animation
Create a countdown clock using createjs libraries.

To run the code, you will need to do some setup steps as below:
1. Install Nodejs
2. Install Grunt CLI globally
3. Install Bower globally
4. Install Browserify globally
5. Go to the root folder of the apps (the folder where you put these codes, where app folder, Gruntfile.js, package.json,... are stored).
6. Install the nodejs related modules with "npm install" command
7. Install the actual code & related libraries with "bower install" command
8. Run "grunt" command to setup tasks & processes
9. Go to your preference browser & put the address http://localhost:9001 to view the apps!

I'm in progress to put the demo online for you easily to see the result. 

Have fun & happy coding!
